# commit-analyser
This program analyses a code repository and generates a report that lists all commits that edited method parameters.

The program expects a HTTPS Git remote URL.

This program analyses commits only for the default branch (generally main or master branch). It would not be difficult to extend the same code to generate report for all branches.
